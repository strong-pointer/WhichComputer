## Installation
- NET 7.0 is required
- IIS Express / ASP.NET Hosting Module Required if using IIS Express (you probably are just using regular http)
- Npm is required

For first time running, run `npm install`.

If you run into any issues, try opening the solution again as a project and deleting the old run configurations.

The recommended way to run the code is `dotnet watch run` in the root directory, as this has hot reload of the website included.
Regular running through the IDE is fine though.

## TODO
- Optimize the tags to create more optimal results
- Add more robust error handling
